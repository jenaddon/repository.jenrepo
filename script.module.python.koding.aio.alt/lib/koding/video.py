def Check_Playback(ignore_dp=False,timeout=10):
    """
This function will return true or false based on video playback. Simply start a stream
(whether via an add-on, direct link to URL or local storage doesn't matter), the code will
then work out if playback is successful. This uses a number of checks and should take into
account all potential glitches which can occur during playback. The return should happen
within a second or two of playback being successful (or not).

CODE: Check_Playback()

AVAILABLE PARAMS:

    ignore_dp  -  By default this is set to True but if set to False
    this will ignore the DialogProgress window. If you use a DP while
    waiting for the stream to start then you'll want to set this True.
    Please bare in mind the reason this check is in place and enabled
    by default is because some streams do bring up a DialogProgress
    when initiated (such as f4m proxy links) and disabling this check
    in those circumstances can cause false positives.

    timeout  -  This is the amount of time you want to allow for playback
    to start before sending back a response of False. Please note if
    ignore_dp is set to True then it will also add a potential 10s extra
    to this amount if a DialogProgress window is open. The default setting
    for this is 10s.

xbmc.Player().play('http://totalrevolution.tv/videos/python_koding/Browse_To_Folder.mov')

    """
Send through a link and test whether or not it's playable on other devices.
Many links include items in the query string which lock the content down to your
IP only so what may open fine for you may not open for anyone else!

This function will attempt to load the page using a proxy. If when trying to access
the link via a proxy the header size and content-type match then we assume the
link will play on any device. This is not fool proof and could potentially return
false positives depending on the security used on the website being accessed.

The return you'll get is a dictionary of the following items:

    'plugin_path' - This will have the path for a plugin, it means the stream was
    originally passed through an add-on to get the final link. If this is not set
    to None then it "should" work on any device so long as that add-on is installed
    (e.g. YouTube).

    'url' - This is the final resolved url which Kodi was playing, you need to check
    the status though to find out whether or not that link is locked to your IP only.

    'status' - This will return one of the following status codes:
        good - The link should work on all IPs.

        bad_link - The link was not valid, won't even play on your current Kodi setup.

        proxy_fail - None of the proxies sent through worked.

        locked - The url only works on this device, if this is the case consider using
        the plugin_path which should generally work on all devices (although this does
        depend on how the developer of that add-on coded up their add-on).

CODE: Link_Tester([proxy_list, url, ip_col, port_col, table])

AVAILABLE PARAMS:

    video  -  This is the url of the video you want to check

    local_check - By default this is set to True and this function will first of
    all attempt to play the video locally with no proxy just to make sure the
    link is valid in the first place. If you want to skip this step then set
    this to False.

    proxy_list  -  If you already have a list of proxies you want to test with
    send them through in the form of a list of dictionaries. Use the following
    format: [{"ip":"0.0.0.0","port":"80"},{"ip":"127.0.0.1","port":"8080"}]

    proxy_url  -  If you want to scrape for online proxies and loop through until a
    working one has been found you can set the url here. If using this then
    proxy_list can be left as the default (None). If you open this Link_Tester
    function with no params the defaults are setup to grab from:
    free-proxy-list.net but there is no guarantee this will always
    work, the website may well change it's layout/security over time.

    ip_col  -  If you've sent through a proxy_url then you'll need to set a column number
    for where in the table the IP address is stored. The default is 0

    port_col  -  If you've sent through a proxy_url then you'll need to set a column number
    for where in the table the port details are stored. The default is 1

    table  -  If you've sent through a proxy_url then you'll need to set a table number.
    The default is 0 - this presumes we need to use the first html table found on the
    page, if you require a different table then alter accordingly - remember zero is the
    first instance so if you want the 3rd table on the page you would set to 2.

EXAMPLE CODE:
vid_test = Link_Tester(video='http://totalrevolution.tv/videos/python_koding/Browse_To_Folder.mov')
if vid_test['status'] == 'bad_link':
    dialog.ok('BAD LINK','The link you sent through cannot even be played on this device let alone another one!')

def Play_Video(video,showbusy=True,content='video',ignore_dp=False,timeout=10, item=None, player=xbmc.Player(), resolver=None):
    """
This will attempt to play a video and return True or False on
whether or not playback was successful. This function is similar
to Check_Playback but this actually tries a number of methods to
play the video whereas Check_Playback does not actually try to
play a video - it will just return True/False on whether or not
a video is currently playing.

If you have m3u or m3u8 playlist links please use the M3U_Selector
function to get the final resolved url.

CODE: Play_Video(video, [showbusy, content, ignore_dp, timeout, item])

AVAILABLE PARAMS:

    (*) video  -  This is the path to the video, this can be a local
    path, online path or a channel number from the PVR.

    showbusy  -  By default this is set to True which means while the
    function is attempting to playback the video the user will see the
    busy dialog. Set to False if you prefer this not to appear but do
    bare in mind a user may navigate to another section and try playing
    something else if they think this isn't doing anything.

    content  -  By default this is set to 'video', however if you're
    passing through audio you may want to set this to 'music' so the
    system can correctly set the tags for artist, song etc.

    ignore_dp  -  By default this is set to True but if set to False
    this will ignore the DialogProgress window. If you use a DP while
    waiting for the stream to start then you'll want to set this True.
    Please bare in mind the reason this check is in place and enabled
    by default is because some streams do bring up a DialogProgress
    when initiated (such as f4m proxy links) and disabling this check
    in those circumstances can cause false positives.

    timeout  -  This is the amount of time you want to allow for playback
    to start before sending back a response of False. Please note if
    ignore_dp is set to True then it will also add a potential 10s extra
    to this amount if a DialogProgress window is open. The default setting
    for this is 10s.

    item  -  By default this is set to None and in this case the metadata
    will be auto-populated from the previous Add_Dir so you'll just get the
    basics like title, thumb and description. If you want to send through your
    own metadata in the form of a dictionary you can do so and it will override
    the auto-generation. If anything else sent through no metadata will be set,
    you would use this option if you've already set metadata in a previous function.

    player  -  By default this is set to xbmc.Player() but you can send through
    a different class/function if required.

    resolver  -  By default this is set to resolveurl but if you prefer to use
    your own custom resolver then just send through that class when calling this
    function and the link sent through will be resolved by your custom resolver.
